          InstanceMapping is a low-level resource that directly manages HANA Cloud instance mappings.
          It takes raw parameters and admin API credentials to create/delete mappings.
          For Kyma environments, use KymaInstanceMapping which automatically extracts
          the required data from Kyma resources and creates an InstanceMapping.
