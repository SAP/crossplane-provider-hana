# The on.pull_request_target runs on changes to a pull request. Contrary to the on.pull_request, this pipeline has access to secrets and can therefore run e2e tests.
# DANGEROUS: 1) with access to secrets it is possible to steal those by a pull request that executes code that reads the secrets and exfiltrates those.
# DANGEROUS: 2) the GITHUB_TOKEN has read and write permissions by default. Therefore, restrict the permissions with the permissions field
# To adress (1), we use an environment pr-e2e-approval that will only execute the job after an explicit approval from team member (after inspecting the code for non-malicious activity).
# If the author of the PR is OWNER, MEMBER or COLLOBORATOR, the environment pr-e2e-no-approval is used that does not require an explicit approval.

# Requiremenets:
# 1) pr-e2e-approval environment configured to require approval before running
# 2) pr-e2e-no-approval environment configured that does not require approval.
